# 🏗️ System Architecture: Dynamic Translation System (POC)

---

## 🎯 Objective

This document explains how different parts of the system interact:

* Frontend (UI)
* Backend (API server)
* Translation Service (Sarvam AI)
* Database

The goal is to clearly understand the **end-to-end data flow**.

## 🧩 High-Level Components

```id="components-001"
[Frontend]  →  [Backend API]  →  [Database]
                         ↓
                 [Translation Service]
                         ↓
                    [Sarvam AI API]
```

---

## 🔹 Component Breakdown

### 1. Frontend (UI)

Responsible for:

* Taking user input (form)
* Displaying translated output
* Allowing user to verify/edit
* Sending API requests to backend

---

### 2. Backend (API Server)

Responsible for:

* Receiving form data
* Saving original data
* Calling translation service
* Returning translated data
* Saving verified translations

---

### 3. Translation Service (Internal Layer)

This is a **wrapper layer** inside backend.

Responsible for:

* Sending text to Sarvam API
* Receiving translated text
* Handling errors/retries

---

### 4. Sarvam AI API (External Service)

Responsible for:

* Translating text from one language to another

---

### 5. Database

Responsible for storing:

* Original data (patient advice)
* Translations (linked to original data)

---

## 🔄 End-to-End Flow (Detailed)

```id="flow-002"
Step 1: User fills the form on frontend

Step 2: Frontend sends POST request to backend
        → /submit-form

Step 3: Backend:
        - Validates input
        - Saves original data in DB

Step 4: Backend triggers translation:
        - Calls Translation Service
        - Sends each field separately to Sarvam API

Step 5: Sarvam API returns translated text

Step 6: Backend sends translated data back to frontend

Step 7: Frontend displays translated fields

Step 8: User reviews and optionally edits translations

Step 9: User clicks "Save Translation"

Step 10: Frontend sends POST request:
         → /save-translation

Step 11: Backend saves translations in DB
```

## ⚙️ Sync vs Async Behavior

### Current POC Approach (Simple Sync Flow)

```id="sync-flow"
Submit Form → Backend → Call Translation API → Return Response
```

* Translation happens immediately after submission
* User waits for response

---

### Why This Is OK for POC

* Simpler to implement
* Easier to debug
* No need for queues/background jobs

---

### Future (Not in Scope)

In production, this could become async:

* Background jobs
* Message queues
* Retry systems

---

## 🧠 Field-Level Translation Flow

We DO NOT send the entire form as one block.

Instead:

```id="field-flow"
For each field:
   send text → translation API → get result
```

Example:

```id="field-example"
nutrition_advice → translate
exercise_advice → translate
injury_care_advice → translate
```

---

### ✅ Why This Approach?

* Easier debugging
* Better control
* Prevents mapping issues
* Allows partial retries

---

## 🔌 API Interaction Overview

### 1. Submit Form API

Frontend → Backend:

```json id="submit-api"
{
  "nutrition_advice": "...",
  "exercise_advice": "...",
  "injury_care_advice": "...",
  "target_language": "hi"
}
```

---

### 2. Translation Happens Internally

Backend:

```id="translation-call"
TranslationService.translate(text, target_language)
```

---

### 3. Response to Frontend

```json id="translation-response"
{
  "translations": {
    "nutrition_advice": "...",
    "exercise_advice": "...",
    "injury_care_advice": "..."
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Save Translation API

Frontend → Backend:

```json id="save-api"
{
  "entity_id": "123",
  "translations": {
    "nutrition_advice": "...",
    "exercise_advice": "..."
  },
  "language": "hi"
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Design Decisions

### 1. Original Data is Always Saved First

* Never depend on translation API to store data

---

### 2. Translation is NOT Auto-Saved

* Requires user verification

---

### 3. Translations are Stored Separately

* Keeps data clean and scalable

---

### 4. Field-Level Mapping is Mandatory

* Avoids ambiguity in data

---

## 🧱 Error Handling (High-Level)

### Possible Failures:

* Translation API fails
* Partial translation fails
* Invalid input

---

### Expected Behavior:

* Original data should still be saved
* Failed translations should be shown as errors
* User should be able to retry

---

## 🚀 Summary

This architecture ensures:

* Clean separation of concerns
* Easy debugging and maintenance
* Clear data traceability
* Simple implementation for POC
