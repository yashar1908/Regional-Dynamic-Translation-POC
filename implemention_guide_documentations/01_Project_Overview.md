# 📘 Project Overview: Dynamic Translation System (POC)

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for a system that can:

1. Accept **user-inputted data** (patient advice)
2. Dynamically **translate the data into a selected regional language**
3. Allow the user to **review and verify the translation**
4. Store both:

   * Original data
   * Verified translated data
     in a structured and traceable way in the database

---

## 🧠 Why Are We Building This?

In real-world healthcare applications, users (patients/doctors) may prefer different regional languages.

This system ensures:

* Users can input data in one language (e.g., English)
* The system translates it into another language (e.g., Hindi, Marathi)
* The translated content is **reviewed before saving**
* All translations are **properly linked to the original data**

---

## 🧩 Example Use Case

A doctor fills out a form for a patient:

* Nutrition Advice → "Eat more protein and vegetables"
* Exercise Advice → "Walk for 30 minutes daily"
* Injury Care Advice → "Apply ice twice a day"

The system should:

1. Save this original data
2. Translate each field into a selected language (e.g., Hindi)
3. Show translated output to the user
4. Allow user to verify/edit
5. Save translations in database with proper mapping

---

## 🔄 High-Level Flow

```id="flow-001"
Step 1: User fills form (Frontend)

Step 2: Form is submitted → Backend API

Step 3: Backend saves original data in DB

Step 4: Backend sends text to Translation API (Sarvam AI)

Step 5: Translated text is returned

Step 6: Frontend displays translated output

Step 7: User verifies/edits translation

Step 8: User clicks "Save Translation"

Step 9: Translations are stored in DB with proper references
```

## 🏗️ What Are We Building in This POC?

### ✅ Included:

* Simple form UI
* Backend APIs
* Integration with Sarvam AI translation API
* Database to store:

  * Original data
  * Translations
* Verification step before saving translations

---

### ❌ Not Included (Out of Scope for POC):

* Performance optimization
* Scaling for large traffic
* Caching mechanisms
* Multi-user concurrency handling
* Authentication/authorization

---

## 🧱 Key Concepts

### 1. Original Data

The data entered by the user (stored immediately after form submission)

---

### 2. Translation

The converted version of the original data in another language

---

### 3. Field-Level Translation

Each field is translated separately:

* nutrition_advice → translated
* exercise_advice → translated
* injury_care_advice → translated

---

### 4. Verification Step

Translations are **not saved immediately**
User must:

* Review
* Optionally edit
* Click "Save"

---

### 5. Traceability (Very Important)

Every translation must:

* Be linked to:

  * Exact record (patient advice)
  * Exact field (nutrition/exercise/etc.)
* Store original text alongside translated text

---

## 🗃️ Expected Final Output

### Frontend:

* Form submission UI
* Translated output displayed clearly
* Save button for translations

---

### Backend:

* APIs for:

  * Saving original data
  * Translating data
  * Saving verified translations

---

### Database:

* One table for original data
* One table for translations
* Proper mapping between them

---

## 🧪 Example Output (Simplified)

### Original Data:

```json id="example-original"
{
  "nutrition_advice": "Eat more protein",
  "exercise_advice": "Walk daily"
}
```

### Translated Data (Hindi):

```json id="example-translated"
{
  "nutrition_advice": "अधिक प्रोटीन खाएं",
  "exercise_advice": "रोज़ चलें"
}
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

The POC is considered complete when:

* [ ] User can submit form data
* [ ] Original data is saved in DB
* [ ] Translation API is successfully called
* [ ] Translated data is displayed on UI
* [ ] User can verify/edit translation
* [ ] Verified translations are saved in DB
* [ ] Each translation is correctly linked to original data

---

## 🚀 Summary

This project demonstrates how to build a **dynamic, traceable, and user-verified translation system** that can be extended in the future for:

* Multiple languages
* Real-time translation
* Large-scale applications
